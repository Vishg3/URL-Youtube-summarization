# URL-Youtube-summarization

Both 'app.py' and 'hfapp.py' are Streamlit apps that summarize content from YouTube or website URLs using LLMs. They accept a URL input from the user and load content either from YouTube or a website. 'app.py' uses a Groq Gemma model while 'hfapp.py' uses a Hugging Face Mistral model to generate a summary of the provided content. Both apps ensure that the URL entered is valid. Users can click a button to generate a summary, and the response is displayed after processing.
